Description: Expression levels of mRNA molecules are regulated by
        different processes, comprising inhibition or activation by
        transcription factors and post-transcriptional degradation by
        microRNAs. biRte uses regulatory networks of TFs, miRNAs and
        possibly other factors, together with mRNA, miRNA and other
        available expression data to predict the relative influence of
        a regulator on the expression of its target genes. Inference is
        done in a Bayesian modeling framework using
        Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo. A special feature is the possibility
        for follow-up network reverse engineering between active
        regulators.
