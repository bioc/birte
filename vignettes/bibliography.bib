  Abstract                 = {Nested effects models (NEMs) are a class of probabilistic models introduced to analyze the effects of gene perturbation screens visible in high-dimensional phenotypes like microarrays or cell morphology. NEMs reverse engineer upstream/downstream relations of cellular signaling cascades. NEMs take as input a set of candidate pathway genes and phenotypic profiles of perturbing these genes. NEMs return a pathway structure explaining the observed perturbation effects. Here, we describe the package nem, an open-source software to efficiently infer NEMs from data. Our software implements several search algorithms for model fitting and is applicable to a wide range of different data types and representations. The methods we present summarize the current state-of-the-art in NEMs. AVAILABILITY: Our software is written in the R language and freely avail-able via the Bioconductor project at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

In combination with the measurement of downstream effects via DNA microarrays, this approach can be used to gain insight into signaling pathways. Nested Effects Models were first introduced by Markowetz et al. as a probabilistic method to reverse engineer signaling cascades based on the nested structure of downstream perturbation effects. The basic framework was substantially extended later on by Fröhlich et al., Markowetz et al., and Tresch and Markowetz. In this paper, we present a review of the complete methodology with a detailed comparison of so far proposed algorithms on a qualitative and quantitative level. As an application, we present results on estimating the signaling network between 13 genes in the ER-alpha pathway of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Comparison with the literature shows a substantial overlap.},

Even if the expression of the signaling genes is not changed, secondary effects in downstream genes shed light on the pathway, and allow partial reconstruction of its topology. RESULTS: We introduce an algorithm to infer non-transcriptional pathway features based on differential gene expression in silencing assays. We demonstrate the power of our algorithm in the controlled setting of simulation studies, and explain its practical use in the context of an RNA interference dataset investigating the response to microbial challenge in Drosophila melanogaster.},

  Abstract                 = {MicroRNAs, or miRNAs, post-transcriptionally repress the expression of protein-coding genes. The human genome encodes over 1000 miRNA genes that collectively target the majority of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Base pairing of the so-called miRNA 'seed' region with mRNAs identifies many thousands of putative targets. Evaluating the strength of the resulting mRNA repression remains challenging, but is essential for a biologically informative ranking of potential miRNA targets. To address these challenges, predictors may use thermodynamic, evolutionary, probabilistic or sequence-based features. We developed an open-source software library, miRmap, which for the first time comprehensively covers all four approaches using 11 predictor features, 3 of which are novel. This allowed us to examine feature correlations and to compare their predictive power in an unbiased way using high-throughput experimental data from immunopurification, transcriptomics, proteomics and polysome fractionation experiments. Overall, target site accessibility appears to be the most predictive feature. Our novel feature based on PhyloP, which evaluates the significance of negative selection, is the best performing predictor in the evolutionary category. We combined all the features into an integrated model that almost doubles the predictive power of TargetScan. miRmap is freely available from http://cegg.unige.ch/mirmap.},

  abstract = {Reverse engineering bioinformatic procedures applied to high-throughput
	experimental data have become instrumental in generating new hypotheses
	about molecular regulatory mechanisms. This has been particularly
	the case for gene expression microarray data, where a large number
	of statistical and computational methodologies have been developed
	in order to assist in building network models of transcriptional
	regulation. A major challenge faced by every different procedure
	is that the number of available samples n for estimating the network
	model is much smaller than the number of genes p forming the system
	under study. This compromises many of the assumptions on which the
	statistics of the methods rely, often leading to unstable performance
	figures. In this work, we apply a recently developed novel methodology
	based in the so-called q-order limited partial correlation graphs,
	qp-graphs, which is specifically tailored towards molecular network
	discovery from microarray expression data with p >> n. Using experimental
	and functional annotation data from Escherichia coli, here we show
	how qp-graphs yield more stable performance figures than other state-of-the-art
	methods when the ratio of genes to experiments exceeds one order
	of magnitude. More importantly, we also show that the better performance
	of the qp-graph method on such a gene-to-sample ratio has a decisive
	impact on the functional coherence of the reverse-engineered transcriptional
	regulatory modules and becomes crucial in such a challenging situation
	in order to enable the discovery of a network of reasonable confidence
	that includes a substantial number of genes relevant to the essayed
	conditions. An R package, called qpgraph implementing this method
	is part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded from (www.bioconductor.org).

  abstract = {Theoretical efforts to understand the regulation of gene expression
	are traditionally centered around the identification of transcription
	factor binding sites at specific DNA positions. More recently these
	efforts have been supplemented by experimental data for relative
	binding affinities of proteins to longer intergenic sequences. The
	question arises to what extent these two approaches converge. In
	this paper, we adopt a physical binding model to predict the relative
	binding affinity of a transcription factor for a given sequence.We
	find that a significant fraction of genome-wide binding data in yeast
	can be accounted for by simple count matrices and a physical model
	with only two parameters. We demonstrate that our approach is both
	conceptually and practically more powerful than traditional methods,
	which require selection of a cutoff. Our analysis yields biologically
	meaningful parameters, suitable for predicting relative binding affinities
	in the absence of experimental binding data.The C source code for

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional
	level and are therefore important cellular components. As is true
	for protein-coding genes, the transcription of miRNAs is regulated
	by transcription factors (TFs), an important class of gene regulators
	that act at the transcriptional level. The correct regulation of
	miRNAs by TFs is critical, and increasing evidence indicates that
	aberrant regulation of miRNAs by TFs can cause phenotypic variations
	and diseases. Therefore, a TF-miRNA regulation database would be
	helpful for understanding the mechanisms by which TFs regulate miRNAs
	and understanding their contribution to diseases. In this study,
	we manually surveyed approximately 5000 reports in the literature
	and identified 243 TF-miRNA regulatory relationships, which were
	supported experimentally from 86 publications. We used these data
	to build a TF-miRNA regulatory database (TransmiR, http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/transmir),
	which contains 82 TFs and 100 miRNAs with 243 regulatory pairs between
	TFs and miRNAs. In addition, we included references to the published
	literature (PubMed ID) information about the organism in which the
	relationship was found, whether the TFs and miRNAs are involved with
	tumors, miRNA function annotation and miRNA-associated disease annotation.
	TransmiR provides a user-friendly interface by which interested parties
	can easily retrieve TF-miRNA regulatory pairs by searching for either
	a miRNA or a TF.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes
	and they may potentially regulate the functions of thousands of genes.
	However, one major issue in miRNA studies is the lack of bioinformatics
	programs to accurately predict miRNA targets. Animal miRNAs have
	limited sequence complementarity to their gene targets, which makes
	it challenging to build target prediction models with high specificity.Here
	we present a new miRNA target prediction program based on support
	vector machines (SVMs) and a large microarray training dataset. By
	systematically analyzing public microarray data, we have identified
	statistically significant features that are important to target downregulation.
	Heterogeneous prediction features have been non-linearly integrated
	in an SVM machine learning framework for the training of our target
	prediction model, MirTarget2. About half of the predicted miRNA target
	sites in human are not conserved in other organisms. Our prediction
	algorithm has been validated with independent experimental data for
	its improved performance on predicting a large number of miRNA down-regulated
	gene targets.All the predicted targets were imported into an online
	database miRDB, which is freely accessible at http://mirdb.org.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: There have been many successful experimental and bioinformatics
	efforts to elucidate transcription factor (TF)-target networks in
	several organisms. For many organisms, these annotations are complemented
	by miRNA-target networks of good quality. Attempts that use these
	networks in combination with gene expression data to draw conclusions
	on TF or miRNA activity are, however, still relatively sparse. RESULTS:
	In this study, we propose Bayesian inference of regulation of transcriptional
	activity (BIRTA) as a novel approach to infer both, TF and miRNA
	activities, from combined miRNA and mRNA expression data in a condition
	specific way. That means our model explains mRNA and miRNA expression
	for a specific experimental condition by the activities of certain
	miRNAs and TFs, hence allowing for differentiating between switches
	from active to inactive (negative switch) and inactive to active
	(positive switch) forms. Extensive simulations of our model reveal
	its good prediction performance in comparison to other approaches.
	Furthermore, the utility of BIRTA is demonstrated at the example
	of Escherichia coli data comparing aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions,
	and by human expression data from pancreas and ovarian cancer. Availability
	and implementation: The method is implemented in the R package birta,
	which is freely available for Bio-conductor (>=2.10) on http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/birta.html.},
